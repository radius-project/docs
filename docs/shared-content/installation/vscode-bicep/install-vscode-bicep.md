We previously released a version of the official Bicep extension specific to Radius called the Radius Bicep extension. We have since updated Radius to be compatible with the official Bicep extension. You can only have one VSCode Bicep extension installed at a time to build on Radius. If you have the Radius Bicep extension installed, you will need to uninstall it and use only the official Bicep extension.
