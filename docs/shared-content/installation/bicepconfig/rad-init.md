1. Install Radius CLI

1. Create a new directory for your app and navigate into it:

    ```bash
    mkdir first-app
    cd first-app
    ```

1. Initialize Radius. Select `Yes` when asked to setup application in the current directory.  

    ```bash
    rad init
    ```
    
This will automatically generate a `bicepconfig.json` with the correct setup in your application's directory.
