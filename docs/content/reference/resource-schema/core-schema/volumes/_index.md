A Radius volume allows you to model an outside resource as a volume that can be mounted to one or more containers. It has a lifecycle that is separate from the container lifecycle, ensuring that data is persisted across container restarts and mounts.

Refer to the [container docs]({{< ref container-schema >}}) to learn how to mount a volume to a container.
