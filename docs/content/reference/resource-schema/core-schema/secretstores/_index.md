Sensitive data, such as TLS certificates, passwords, and keys, are referred to as a secret. A Radius secret store enables you to store these secrets or reference pre-existing secrets found in external storage solutions, such as Azure Keyvault or AWS Secrets Manager. For instance, the Applications.Core/gateways resource can use this resource to store a TLS certificate and reference it.
