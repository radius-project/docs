Welcome to the Project Radius community. We are currently in a private release phase which is open to Microsoft FTEs and select partners. The team is working on a public preview release which will be announced on this page.

## Discussions

The best way to interact with us currently is through the [Project Radius Preview Teams Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a97f6300da02447aba041e010c478567e%40thread.tacv2/Preview%2520Discussion?groupId=7eb9839b-5ec6-448d-8447-a820b6bd2cdd&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) or your Radius Core Team contact. Feel free to post into the group discussion so that other community members can jump in and answer as well.
