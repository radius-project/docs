Welcome to the Radius community. We are currently in a private release phase which is open to Microsoft FTEs and select partners. The team is working on a public preview release which will be announced on this page.

GitHub access is optional and not required to try out and run Radius. If you would like to directly file Issues and have access to the source code, please contact your Radius Core Team contact.

For all other information regarding the Radius community, including community meetings, communication channels, and more, please see the Radius [community repo](https://github.com/project-radius/community/#community-meetings).
