## Overview

Radius is currently in beta and is not backward compatible with previous releases. Radius introduces breaking changes between releases and we recommend doing a fresh installation of the latest version of Radius every time after a release.

We are working on the versioning strategy and will be introducing a versioning policy in the future.
