## Overview

Radius is currently in an early alpha preview and does not offer backward compatibility with previous releases. Breaking changes may happen between releases and we recommend doing a fresh installation of the latest version of Radius after every release.

We are working on the versioning strategy and will be introducing a versioning policy in the future.
