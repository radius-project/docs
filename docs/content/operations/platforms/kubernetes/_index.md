Project Radius can be installed and run on top of Kubernetes clusters. This allows you to deploy and manage Radius applications across any cloud or on-premises cluster.

## Supported clusters

The following clusters have been tested and validated to ensure they support all of the features of Project Radius:

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters are the easiest way to get up and running quickly with a Radius environment. To learn how to setup a cluster visit the [Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal?tabs=azure-cli).

Note that [AKS-managed AAD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/managed-aad) is not supported currently.

Once deployed and your kubectl context has been set as your default, you can run the following to configure the Radius control plane:

```bash
az aks create --subscription mySubscription --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 1
az aks get-credentials --subscription mySubscription --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
rad env init kubernetes -i
```

[k3d](https://k3d.io) is a lightweight wrapper to run [k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in Docker. Use the following commands to create a new cluster and install the Radius control plane, along with a new environment:

```bash
k3d cluster create -p "8081:80@loadbalancer" --k3s-arg "--disable=traefik@server:0"
rad env init kubernetes -i --public-endpoint-override 'http://localhost:8081'
```

[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters inside Docker containers. Use the following setup to create a new cluster and install the Radius control plane, along with a new environment:

First, ensure that memory resource is 4GB or more in `Resource` setting of `Preferences` if you're using Docker Desktop.

Second, copy the text below into a new file `kind-config.yaml`:
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 8080
    listenAddress: "0.0.0.0"  
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 8443
    listenAddress: "0.0.0.0"
```

Then, create a kind cluster with this config and initialize your Radius environment:
```bash
# Create the kind cluster
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml

# Verify that the nodes are ready
# (You should see 2 nodes listed with status Ready)
kubectl get nodes

# Install Radius
rad env init kubernetes -i --public-endpoint-override 'http://localhost:8080'
```
