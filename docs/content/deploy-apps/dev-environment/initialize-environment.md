## Overview 

Radius development environments enable you to quickly get started with Radius and begin writing new applications. Dev environments come preloaded with a set of development [recipes]({{< ref "author-apps/recipes" >}}) with lightweight containers for commonly used resources such as Redis and Mongo, helping you get up and running instantly.

## Pre-requisites

1. Have a [Kubernetes cluster]({{< ref "/operations/platforms/kubernetes" >}}) handy.

   *Visit the [Kubernetes platform docs]({{< ref "/operations/platforms/kubernetes" >}}) for a list of supported clusters and specific cluster requirements.*

1. Ensure your target kubectl context is set as the default:
   ```bash
   kubectl config current-context
   ```

## How-to: Initialize a new dev environment

1. Initialize a new [Radius environment]({{< ref "operations/environments/overview">}}) with `rad init --dev` command:
   ```bash
   rad init --dev
   ```
   
   Select `Yes` to setup the app.bicep in the current directory

   ```
   Initializing Radius...                                                
                                                                      
   üïî Install Radius 0.21                                             
      - Kubernetes cluster: kind
      - Kubernetes namespace: radius-system                              
   ‚è≥ Create new environment default                                     
      - Kubernetes namespace: default                                    
      - Recipe pack: dev                                                 
   ‚è≥ Scaffold application                                          
   ‚è≥ Update local configuration                                                 
   ```                                             

2. Verify the initialization by running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments -n radius-system
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   ucp                       1/1     1            1           53s
   appcore-rp                1/1     1            1           53s
   bicep-de                  1/1     1            1           53s
   contour-contour           1/1     1            1           46s
   ```

   You can also use [`rad env list`]({{< ref rad_env_list.md >}}) to view your environment:
   
   ```bash
   rad env list
   ```
3. Use `rad recipe list` to see the list of available recipes:
   ```bash
   rad recipe list
   ```
   ```
   NAME      TYPE                              TEMPLATE KIND  TEMPLATE
   default   Applications.Link/mongoDatabases  bicep          radius.azurecr.io/recipes/dev/mongodatabases:latest
   default   Applications.Link/redisCaches     bicep          radius.azurecr.io/recipes/dev/rediscaches:latest
   ``` 
   You can follow the [recipes]({{< ref "author-apps/recipes" >}}) documentation to learn more about the recipes and how to use them in your application.
