This tutorial will teach you the following about recipes

* How to use ‚Äúdev‚Äù Recipes in your Radius Environment to quickly run with containerized infrastructure.
* How to deploy your own Recipes in your Radius Environment to leverage Azure/AWS resources.

## Recipes overview

[Recipes]({{< ref "guides/recipes/overview">}}) enable a separation of concerns between infrastructure teams and developers by automating infrastructure deployment. Developers define _what_ they need (_Redis, Mongo, etc._), and operators define _how_ it will be deployed (_Azure/AWS/Kubernetes infrastructure_).

{{< button text="Learn more about Recipes here" page="/guides/recipes/overview" newtab="true" >}}

## Application overview

This application is a simple to-do list which stores and visualizes to-do items. It consists of a frontend [container]({{< ref "guides/author-apps/containers" >}}) and a backend [Redis Cache]({{< ref redis >}}).

{{< alert title="üí° Portable resources" color="info" >}}
Developers don't need to specify what cloud resources they're using in their application. Instead, they choose the portable Redis API which can be provided by any cloud provider (or a Docker container). When deployed, a Recipe will select what infrastructure to deploy and run.
{{< /alert >}}

## Prerequisites

- Install the [rad CLI]({{< ref getting-started >}})
- Setup a supported [Kubernetes cluster]({{< ref "guides/operations/kubernetes" >}})

## Step 1: Initialize a Radius environment

1. Begin in a new directory for your application:

   ```bash
   mkdir recipes
   cd recipes
   ```
2. Initialize a new dev environment:

   ```bash
   rad init
   ```

   **Select 'Yes' when prompted to create an application.**

3. Use [`rad recipe list`]({{< ref rad_recipe_list >}}) to view the Recipes in your environment:

   ```bash
   rad recipe list 
   ```

   You should see a table of available Recipes:
   
   ```
   NAME      TYPE                                    TEMPLATE KIND  TEMPLATE VERSION  TEMPLATE
   default   Applications.Datastores/sqlDatabases    bicep                            radius.azurecr.io/recipes/local-dev/sqldatabases:latest
   default   Applications.Messaging/rabbitMQQueues   bicep                            radius.azurecr.io/recipes/local-dev/rabbitmqqueues:latest
   default   Applications.Dapr/pubSubBrokers         bicep                            radius.azurecr.io/recipes/local-dev/pubsubbrokers:latest
   default   Applications.Dapr/secretStores          bicep                            radius.azurecr.io/recipes/local-dev/secretstores:latest
   default   Applications.Dapr/stateStores           bicep                            radius.azurecr.io/recipes/local-dev/statestores:latest
   default   Applications.Datastores/mongoDatabases  bicep                            radius.azurecr.io/recipes/local-dev/mongodatabases:latest
   default   Applications.Datastores/redisCaches     bicep                            radius.azurecr.io/recipes/local-dev/rediscaches:latest
   ```

{{< alert title="üí° Dev Recipes" color="info" >}}
Dev environments are preloaded with [`dev` Recipes]({{< ref "guides/recipes/overview#use-community-dev-recipes" >}}), a set of Recipes that allow you to quickly get up and running with lightweight containerized infrastructure. In This how-to guide, the dev Redis Recipe deploys a lightweight Redis container into your Kubernetes cluster.

When a Recipe is named "default" it will be used by default when deploying resources when a Recipe is not specified.
{{< /alert >}}

## Step 2: Define your application

Update `app.bicep` with the following set of resources: 

> app.bicep was created automatically when you ran `rad init`

{{< rad file="snippets/app.bicep" embed=true >}}

Note that no Recipe name is specified with 'db', so it will be using the default Recipe in your environment.

## Step 3: Deploy your application

1. Run [`rad deploy`]({{< ref rad_deploy >}}) to deploy your application:

   ```bash
   rad deploy ./app.bicep
   ```

   You should see the following output:
   ```
   Building app.bicep...
   Deploying template './app.bicep' for application 'recipes' and environment 'default' from workspace 'default'...

   Deployment In Progress...

   Completed            db              Applications.Datastores/redisCaches
   Completed            webapp          Applications.Core/applications
   Completed            frontend        Applications.Core/containers

   Deployment Complete

   Resources:
      webapp          Applications.Core/applications
      frontend        Applications.Core/containers
      db              Applications.Datastores/redisCaches
   ```

   Your application is now deployed and running in your Kubernetes cluster.

2. List your Kubernetes Pods to see the infrastructure container deployed by the Recipe:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n default-recipes
   ```

   You will see your 'frontend' container, along with the Redis cache that was automatically created by the default dev Recipe:

   ```
   NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   frontend-6d447f5994-pnmzv              1/1     Running   0          13m
   redis-ymbjcqyjzwkpg-66fdbf8bb6-brb6q   2/2     Running   0          13m
   ```

3. Port-forward the container to your machine with `rad resource expose`:

   ```bash
   rad resource expose containers frontend --port 3000
   ```

4. Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

   You can now see both the environment variables of your container under Radius Connections as well as interact with the `Todo App` and add/remove items in it as wanted:

## Step 4: Use Azure/AWS recipes in your application

This step requires an Azure subscription or an AWS account to deploy cloud resources, which will incur costs. You will need to add the [Azure/AWS cloud provider]({{< ref providers >}}) to your environment in order to deploy Azure/AWS resources and leverage Azure Recipes.

{{< tabs Azure AWS>}}

{{% codetab %}}
1. Delete your existing Redis cache, which we will redeploy with an Azure resource:

   ```bash
   rad resource delete rediscaches db
   ```
1. Manually add the Azure cloud provider to your Radius environment

   Follow the steps [here]({{< ref "howto-azure-provider#manual-configuration" >}}) to add the Azure cloud provider to your existing environment.

2. Register the Recipe to your Radius Environment:

   ```bash
   rad recipe register azure --environment default --template-kind bicep --template-path radius.azurecr.io/recipes/azure/rediscaches:{{< param tag_version >}} --resource-type Applications.Datastores/redisCaches 
   ```

3. Update your db resource to use the `azure` Recipe, instead of the default Recipe:

   {{< rad file="snippets/app-azure.bicep" marker="//DB" embed=true >}}

4. Redeploy your application to your environment:

   ```bash
   rad deploy ./app.bicep 
   ```

   This operation may take some time, as the 'azure' Recipe is deploying an Azure Cache for Redis resource into your Azure subscription. Once complete, you should see:

   ```
   Building ./app.bicep...
   Deploying template './app.bicep' for application 'recipes' and environment 'default' from workspace 'default'...

   Deployment In Progress... 

   Completed            webapp          Applications.Core/applications
   Completed            db              Applications.Datastores/redisCaches
   Completed            frontend        Applications.Core/containers

   Deployment Complete

   Resources:
      webapp          Applications.Core/applications
      frontend        Applications.Core/containers
      db              Applications.Datastores/redisCaches
   ```

5. Use the az CLI to see your newly deployed Azure Cache for Redis:

   ```bash
   az redis list --subscription "My Subscription" --query "[].name" 
   ```

   You should see the name of your Redis cache, which is prefixed `cache`:

   ```
   [
     "cache-goqoxgqkw2ogw"
   ]
   ```
1. Port-forward the container to your machine with `rad resource expose`:

   ```bash
   rad resource expose containers frontend --port 3000
   ```

1. Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

   You can now see environment variables of your container under Radius Connections updated with the details of the Azure Cache for Redis and the Todo app now uses the Azure cache for Redis as the data store

> *You can run this only on an EKS cluster. Make sure that the each of the Subnets in your EKS cluster Subnet Group are within the [list of supported MemoryDB availability zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/memorydb/latest/devguide/subnetgroups.html)*

1. Delete your existing Redis cache, which we will redeploy with an AWS resource:

   ```bash
   rad resource delete rediscaches db
   ```

1. Manually add the AWS cloud provider to your Radius environment

   Follow the steps [here]({{< ref "howto-aws-provider#manual-configuration" >}}) to add the AWS cloud provider to your existing environment

1. Register the Recipe to your Radius Environment:

   ```bash
   rad recipe register aws --environment default --template-kind bicep --template-path radius.azurecr.io/recipes/rediscaches/aws:1.0 --link-type Applications.Link/redisCaches --parameters eksClusterName=YOUR_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME
   ```
   > *Note: Passing the `eksClusterName` during the registration of the Recipe is a temporary additional step as Radius builds up AWS support.*

1. Update your db resource to use the `aws` Recipe, instead of the default Recipe:

   {{< rad file="snippets/app-aws.bicep" marker="//DB" embed=true >}}

   Update the recipe name to `aws` to use the Amazon MemoryDB for Redis.

1. Deploy your application to your environment:

   ```bash
   rad deploy ./app.bicep 
   ```

   This operation may take some time, as the ‚Äòaws‚Äô Recipe is deploying an AWS MemoryDB for Redis resource in your AWS account. Once complete, you should see:

   ```
   Building ./app.bicep...
   Deploying template './app.bicep' for application 'recipes' and environment 'default' from workspace 'default'...

   Deployment In Progress... 

   Completed            webapp          Applications.Core/applications
   Completed            db              Applications.Link/redisCaches
   Completed            frontend        Applications.Core/containers

   Deployment Complete

   Resources:
      webapp          Applications.Core/applications
      frontend        Applications.Core/containers
      db              Applications.Link/redisCaches
   ```

1. Port-forward the container to your machine with `rad resource expose`:

   ```bash
   rad resource expose containers frontend --port 3000
   ```

1. Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

   You can now see environment variables of your container under Radius Connections updated with the details of the Amazon Memory Db for Redis and the Todo app now uses the Amazon Memory Db for Redis as the data store

## Step 5: Cleanup your environment

1. You can use the rad CLI to [delete your environment]({{< ref rad_env_delete.md >}}) and all the  Radius resources running on your cluster:
   
   ```bash
   rad env delete default --yes
   ```
