## Create a Bicep file

Radius uses the [Bicep language]({{< ref bicep >}}) as its file-format and structure. In this tutorial you will define an app named `dapr-tutorial` that will contain the containers, statestore, and route resources, all described in Bicep.

Create a new file named `dapr.bicep` and paste the following:

{{< rad file="snippets/app.bicep" embed=true >}}

## Add `backend` container

Next you'll add a `backend` [container]({{< ref container >}}) resource for the website's backend.

Radius captures the relationships and intentions behind an application, which simplifies deployment and management. The single `backend` resource in your Bicep file will contain everything needed for the website backend to run.

Your `backend` resource, which has resource type Container, will specify:

- **container image:** `radius.azurecr.io/daprtutorial-backend`, a Docker image the container will run. This is where your application's backend code lives.
- **ports**: orders will be received on port 3000.

Update your dapr.bicep file to match the full application definition:

{{< rad file="snippets/backend.bicep" embed=true >}}

## Deploy the application

Now you are ready to deploy the application for the first time.

1. Deploy to your Radius environment via the rad CLI:

   ```sh
   rad deploy dapr.bicep
   ```

   This will deploy the application into your environment and launch the container resource for the backend website.

1. Confirm that your Radius application was deployed:

   ```sh
   rad resource list --application dapr-tutorial
   ```

   You should see your `backend` resource. Example output:

   ```
   RESOURCE   TYPE
   backend    Container
   ```

1. To test your `dapr-tutorial` application, open a local tunnel to your application:

   ```sh
   rad resource expose Container backend --application dapr-tutorial --port 3000
   ```

   {{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ rad resource expose" color="primary" %}}
   The [`rad resource expose`]({{< ref rad_resource_expose.md >}}) command accepts the resource type, the resource name, and flags for application name and port. If you changed any of these values when deploying, update your command to match.
   {{% /alert %}}

1. Visit the URL http://localhost:3000/order in your browser. For now, you should see a message like:

   ```
   {"message":"The container is running, but Dapr has not been configured."}
   ```

   If the message matches, then it means that the container is running as expected.

1. When you are done testing press `CTRL+C` to terminate the port-forward.
