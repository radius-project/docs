## Overview

This tutorial will teach you how to deploy a website as a Radius application from first principles. You will take away the following 
- Enough knowledge to map your own application in Radius 
- Separation of concerns between the different personas involved in a deployment
- Achieve portability via connectors between your local and cloud environmnets 

## Tutorial steps

This tutorial contains the following sections:

- App overview - Overview of the website tutorial application
- Author app definition - Define the application definition with container, gateway and http routes
- Add a database connector - Connect a MongoDB to the website tutorial application using a connector and deploy to a Radius environment
- Swap a connector resource - Swap a MongoDB container for an Azure CosmosDB instance to back the connector and deploy the app to a Radius environment with Azure cloud provider configured

## Prerequisites

- [Install Radius CLI]({{< ref "getting-started#install-radius-cli" >}})
- [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)
  - The [Radius VSCode extension]({{< ref "getting-started#setup-vscode" >}}) provides syntax highlighting, completion, and linting.
  - You can also complete this tutorial with any basic text editor.

## Initialize a Radius environment

A Radius Kubernetes envionment can run in a Kubernetes cluster running on any platform.

You can view the current context for kubectl by running
```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

Use the [`rad env init kubernetes` command]({{< ref rad_env_init_Kubernetes >}}) to initialize a new environment into your current kubectl context.
```bash
rad env init kubernetes -i
```

Follow the prompts, you can choose to add the [Azure cloud provider]({{<ref providers>}}) as you will be deploying an Azure cosmosdb resource in the later part of the tutorial. You can also skip adding cloud provider if you do not have an Azure subscription

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ About namespaces" color="success" %}}
When Radius initializes a Kubernetes environment, it will install the Radius control plane into your cluster if needed, using the `radius-system` namespace. These control plane resources aren't part your application. The namespace specified in interactive mode will be used for future application deployments by default.

1. Verify initialization

   To verify the environment initialization succeeded, you can run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments -n radius-system
   ```

   The output should look like this:

   ```bash
